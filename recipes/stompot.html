<h3 class="headings"> Description</h3>
<p> This is a comfort food that you need to remember. <br>
The Dutch have perfected lazy cooking and somehow have made it delicious. <br> 
This meal can serve as many as you like just increase/decrease the ingredients</p>
<h3 class="headings"> Ingredients</h3>
<ul> 
    <li> 5 large potatoes, peeled and cut into pieces</li>
    <li> 4 tsp salt </li>
    <li> 2 tbsp butter </li>
    <li> ½ cup milk </li>
    <li> ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper </li>
    <li> 3 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li> 2 onions, peeled and chopped</li>
    <li> 2 large garlic cloves, peeled and minced</li>
    <li> half a pack of boerenkool</li>
    <li> 1 or 2 rookworst</li>
    <li> green onion for garnish, optional</li> </ul>
<h3 class="headings"> Method to her madness</h3>
<ol> 
    <li> Put potatoes and 2 teaspoons salt in a large pot. Cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer and cook until potatoes are tender, 10-15 minutes. Scoop out a cup of potato cooking-water and set aside. <br>
         Drain potatoes and return them to the pot. Add butter, milk, 2 teaspoons salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper. Mash potatoes with a potato-masher. For creamier potatoes add potato cooking-water, a little at a time, stirring, until you get the desired texture.</li>
     <li> In a large heavy skillet or pot with a lid, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-low heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 6-7 minutes, until translucent. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Raise heat to medium. <br>
         Add boerenkool, ¼ cup water, and ½ teaspoon vinegar. Cover pot and wait 2-3 minutes for the boerenkool to wilt. Remove cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3-4 minutes longer or until the kale is tender. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt <br> and a few grinds of black pepper. Add kale mixture to potatoes and mash until thoroughly combined.</li>
    <li> In the same heavy skillet used for the boerenkool, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat. Cook the sausages for 4-5 minutes, until nicely browned on both sides and heated through. </li>
    <li> Divide the boerenkool-potato mash between 4 or 5 bowls. Arrange sausages on top. Drizzle on a teaspoon of olive oil per bowl and sprinkle with chopped scallions, if you like. Enjoy!</li>
