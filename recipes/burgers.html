<h3> Description</h3>
<p> Who does not like a juiced up burger? No one, exactly my point. <br>
The americans got fat for a reason, indulge with them and destroy this beast of a burger. <br> 
You will not regret it..... Until you hit the loo after.</p>
<h3> Ingredients</h3>
<ul> 
    <li> 900 grams ground beef</li>
    <li> 1 large egg</li>
    <li> 3 tbsp milk</li>
    <li> 2 tbsp worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li> 2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li> 1 onion, peeled and chopped</li>
    <li> ¼ tsp cayenne pepper</li>
    <li> ¼ tsp salt</li>
    <li> ¾ Cup Breadcrumbs </li>
    <li> your choice of veges</li> </ul>
<h3> Method to the fatness</h3>
<ol> 
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, egg, milk, Worcestershire sauce, minced garlic, onion, cayenne pepper, sea salt, and freshly ground pepper. <br> Use your hands or a spoon to mix the ingredients thoroughly until well combined. </li>
    <li> Once the ingredients are mixed, add the breadcrumbs to the mixture. Mix again until the breadcrumbs are evenly distributed throughout the meat mixture</li>
    <li> Divide the meat mixture into equal portions, depending on how large you want your burgers to be. Use your hands to shape each portion into a patty, <br> ensuring they are of uniform size and thickness for even cooking. </li>
    <li> Preheat your grill or skillet over medium-high heat. If using a grill, lightly oil the grates to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li>Once the grill or skillet is hot, place the burger patties on the cooking surface. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until the burgers reach your desired level of doneness. </li>
    <li> Once cooked to your liking, remove the burgers from the heat and let them rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute and ensures a juicy, flavorful burger. </li>
    <li> Serve the burgers on your favorite buns or lettuce wraps, topped with your preferred condiments and toppings. ENJOY!</li>
